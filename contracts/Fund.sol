// @title Fund
// @dev This is middle component of the fund and provides all the functionality needed to manage an open-ended fund.
// It supports adding a mintable token for representing shares of the fund
// Shares of the fund can be bought after the crowdsale has commenced at a dynamic price set by the owners.
// Similarly shares can also be sold at any point for Ether (some closed-end funds do not provide this feature)
// The fund supports moving Ether from a set of internal wallets. In reality this wallets would be both hot and
// cold wallets if large sums are managed. For the usage of cold wallet a multi-sig management contract is required.
// This fund can be managed from a simple account wallet or by a multi-sig contract. A suggestion for a multi-sig
// contract with a strong focus on trust is presented in the FundOperator contract.
// This class currently provides no support for initial crowdsales, but can be easily extended.
